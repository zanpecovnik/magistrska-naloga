In order to avoid these consequences, we must first identify the causes which are responsible for the development of obesity. One of the main causes is undoubtedly an unhealthy lifestyle which is a result of poor eating habits and insufficient exercise. Aim: The aim of this research was to investigate the adolescent dietary behaviours and physical activity, to determine how the overweight adolescents see their body image and self-esteem and to indentify their knowledge of eating disorders. Method: The research is based on the quantitative descriptive and non-experimental causal method of the empirical research. The instrument for data collection was a written survey questionnaire. We used a non-randomized, purposive sample. The survey was conducted on a sample of 167 male and female students in the ratio of 40:60, in the following secondary schools: Jesenice Secondary School, Secondary School of Nursing Ljubljana and Secondary Engineering School Ljubljana. The data were analyzed with the statistical analysis package SPSS 20. The realization of the sample was 70 per cent. Results: The results of the research showed that (52.4%) of the respondents were satisfied with their body weight, their average age was 18 years. (37.8%) of the students were physically active more than three times a week. (32.3%) of the respondents answered that their weight strongly affected their opinions of themselves. (64.0%) of the students had knowledge of the terms anorexia and bulimia. The first source of information regarding eating disorders was a general practitioner (73.4%). The survey questionnaire showed that the eating habits of adolescents were rather poor. Also, their physical activity proved to be rather unsatisfactory. Discussion: In adolescents, it was found that their eating habits were quite poor, especially the omission of important meals. Their physical activity was rather low (inactive) as compared to the previous generations. However, the adolescents were much better informed about eating disorders (terms anorexia and bulimia), but the familiarity with the treatment of eating disorders was still low. It is important to provide continued health education from the primary school onward, with an emphasis on healthy eating habits throughout life. Clearly, we need further research and analysis of the nutritional patterns of young people, which could provide more insight into their dietary lives.\",\n","    \"The study shows various types of lawns. The focus is on the importance of turf as the basis of most of the landscape scheme. The lawn is the basic plot, where the different elements create volume in space. To achieve a quality lawn, we need to know the right steps of development and maintenance of lawn areas. The study is describing types of grass, suitable for lawns in our ecological conditions. Grass species are arranged in a table, according to habitat conditions (light, soil, moisture, temperature), which enables easier selection of grass species for different areas. Lawns can be divided into different types of use - decorative, useful and sport lawns, lawns in the landscape. Lawn is made of different grass species, depending on the type of lawn and site conditions. Preparation and mainteince are very importat. For the turf to serve its purpose, there procedures are various, depending on the type of lawn you maintain. Lawn maintenance consists of a series of measures such as mowing, irrigation, fertilization, regeneration. They are described in individual chapters. Ornamental and sports turf maintenance is more demanding than for general lawns. The study also presents alternatives to traditional lawns that are less demanding for maintenance and more acceptable for the environment (natural - flower meadow, perennials). It also describes the species which are suitable for non - grass lawns. The study presents various principles of grass design. Analysis of the state of public green areas in the city of Kranj showes that a lot of lawn design is unattractive. People don`t use them often, there for they are losing their value.\",\n","    \"This research project speaks about improvement of existing warehousing operation in the company TRIFIX Tržič. Intention of this improvement are lower costs of operation, to reduce the stock in the warehouse and to improve efficiency of the warehouse operation with initiation of paper-less operation. The stock in the warehouse makes possible that production and sales works undisturbed, but at the same time it bounds a lot of funds and is the cause of high operating costs. Because of changeable external and internal conditions is the stock sometimes smaller, sometimes bigger. As a lot of factors are changing all the time, also the stock in the warehouse must be changed all the time. The improvement is based on use of new technologies, which enables the upgrade of an existing system, such as electronic capture of data based on the EAN code and electronic buisness operation. The improvement can be made at the same time with the start of use of the EAN code system, execution of analytic method for optimizing of the warehousing, which means definition of signalling stock and optimal order quantities. The improvement of warehouse operation is presented in three steps. First step is with help of analytic method to sort the stocked materials according to the height of the warehousing costs, which are caused by these materials and the definition of normatives of the stocked materials, concerning the highest costs of warehouse operating costs. Second step is the introduction of the EAN code, which represents a base for electronic capture of data. Third step is upgrading of the existing electronic buisness system with MIT engineering software, which enables the introduction of full electronic buisness operation. The improvement is compared to the previos kind of buisness operation system of the company. The improvement is also compared with the old system from the financial point of view.\",\n","    \"This diploma present the system INFRANET, the building blocks of different options and links for reliable transmission of alarm messages.

It emphasizes the significant increase in obesity rates over the last few decades, largely due to lifestyle changes such as reduced physical activity and increased consumption of energy-dense foods. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes obesity as a major health challenge of the 21st century, with substantial impacts on public health systems and an increase in related chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and even cancer. The text highlights that obesity is not just a physical health issue but also affects emotional well-being, leading to disorders such as bulimia nervosa and binge eating, especially among adolescents. The importance of balanced nutrition during adolescence—a critical period of growth and development—is emphasized, noting that unhealthy eating habits established during this time can lead to lifelong health problems. Furthermore, the document outlines the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing obesity, including proper nutritional assessment, physical activity, and psychological support. It also mentions the role of education in promoting healthy eating habits and the challenges posed by modern lifestyles, such as the prevalence of fast food, sedentary behavior, and the influence of media. The overall message is a call to action for more effective public health strategies to combat the rising trend of obesity in young people.\",\n","    \"The thesis explores the significance and management of grassed surfaces, particularly lawns, in urban and landscape architecture. Grassed areas are fundamental to various green spaces, serving both functional and aesthetic roles. The study examines different types of grasses suitable for Slovenia's ecological conditions, detailing their botanical characteristics and environmental requirements. It also discusses the technology involved in the creation and maintenance of lawns, highlighting the challenges such as high costs and environmental impact. As an alternative, natural flowering meadows, which are more ecologically friendly and support biodiversity, are proposed. The thesis further analyzes the design principles of grassed surfaces, including cultivated lawns, natural meadows, and ornamental grasses. It points out that in Slovenia, grassed surfaces often lack creativity and are underutilized, which diminishes their value and leads to neglect. The research includes a case study of grassed areas in Kranj, Slovenia, evaluating their design, use, and maintenance. The findings suggest that by adopting more diverse and ecologically sensitive design approaches, grassed areas can be made more attractive and functional, contributing to urban biodiversity and reducing maintenance costs. The study underscores the need for greater attention to the design and maintenance of grassed surfaces in urban planning to enhance their ecological and aesthetic value.\",\n","    \"The thesis focuses on the challenges faced by TRIFIX d.o.o., a Slovenian company specializing in fastening products for construction. The company operates in a rapidly changing environment characterized by technological advancements, economic fluctuations, and increased competition. The author identifies inefficiencies in the company's warehouse and procurement operations, particularly in stock replenishment methods, which are currently based on the warehouse manager's intuition rather than systematic data analysis. This approach leads to increased costs and inefficiencies. The thesis aims to justify the introduction of improvements in the warehouse and procurement processes at TRIFIX d.o.o. The proposed improvements include the implementation of new technologies, such as barcode systems and electronic data capture, to optimize inventory management. Additionally, the author suggests adopting analytical methods to determine safety stock levels and optimal order quantities, which could reduce costs and enhance the company's competitiveness. The thesis also outlines the broader goals of optimizing procurement, storage, and inventory management to reduce overall organizational costs and improve economic efficiency. By focusing on modernizing these processes, the author believes TRIFIX d.o.o. can better navigate the challenges of the global market and maintain its competitive edge.
